Safety
===================

- The following safety features have been engineered into the AgriBot to provide a safer user experience and help mitigate various hazards.

E-stop push button
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- A physical E-stop button is located on top of the electronics box and can be pressed to immediately stop and unpower all motors and peripherals.

- This can be used in case of being pinched or entangled in the machine, or if the machine is behaving unexpectedly.

|

Stall detection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- AgriBot can detect motor stalls and will by default E-stop if a movement error occurs too many times in a row.

- This can prevent injury and potential damage to the machine.

|

Fuse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- A fuse is located on the Agriduino to protect the electronics from over-current conditions that may be caused by a short or other malfunction.

|

Pin guard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- AgriBot can be configured to set a peripheral to a certain state after a timeout period.

- This can act as a secondary precaution in case a poorly designed sequence or custom code instructs AgriBot to leave a peripheral in an unsafe state for an extended period of time, such as leaving the solenoid valve open for too long.
