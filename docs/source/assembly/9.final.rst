Storing extra parts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Your AgriBot kit included a few extra pieces of some small parts such as screws and nuts just in case we miscounted by a few or you lost anything in the grass during assembly.

- We recommend keeping everything that is left over in a box along with the getting started guide, camera calibration card, the microSD card adpater, and all of the assembly tools.

- For illustrative purposes only. Not all kits will have these exact parts left over after assembly.

Trimming belts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- About a week after using your AgriBot, you may consider using scissors to trim off excess belt.

- This can make for a tidier installation, especially if you didn’t build your AgriBot to the maximum possible size.

- Just keep in mind that once cut, there is no gluing the belt back together - you would need to order new belts if you made a mistake.

- Only trim if you are certain you won’t need the extra length!
