Step 1: Add the gantry V-wheels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Attach four V-wheels with standard spacers to the cross-slide plate using M5 x 30mm screws and M5 flange locknuts.

- Attach three V-wheels with eccentric spacer to the holes shown using M5 x 30mm screws and M5 flange locknuts.

Step 2: Add the Z-axis V-wheels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Flip the cross-slide over so that all of the V-wheels you have added so far are facing away from you.

- Attach two V-wheels with standard spacers to the holes shown using M5 x 30mm screws and M5 flange locknuts.

Step 3: Add the leadscrew block
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Attach the leadscrew block to the cross-slide plate using M5 x 30mm screws and M5 flange locknuts.

Step 4: Add the stepper motor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Insert a motor into a horizontal motor housing such that the motor and encoder connectors are facing down, out the open face of the housing.

- Then attach the motor and housing to the cross-slide plate with four M3 x 12mm screws.

- Slide a pulley onto the motor shaft.

- Make sure that both setscrews are lined up with the flat spots of the motor shaft.

- Then tighten the setscrews with the 2mm driver.

Step 5: Add the cable carrier mount
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Attach the 80mm cable carrier mount to the cross-slide plate using M5 x 16mm screws and M5 flange locknuts.

- The bracket should be on the opposite side of the plate as the motor.

Step 6: Slide the cross-slide onto the gantry main beam
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- In order for the cross-slide to slide smoothly and wobble-free on the gantry main beam, you must first adjust the eccentric spacers of the bottom three V-wheels.

- Adjust the eccentric spacers using the eccentric spacer adjustment reference guide.

- Once you have adjusted the eccentric spacers, slide the cross-slide onto the gantry main beam.

- The cross-slide should move easily across the full width of the gantry. If you feel any significant resistance, re-adjust the eccentric spacers so that there is less resistance to movement.

- On XL models, pay special attention at the connection point between the two gantry main beams.

- If there is any significant bump or resistance to movement at the joint, you may use sand paper to sand away the bump.

Step 7: Feed and secure the belt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Attach a belt clip to the end of the gantry main beam using two M5 x 10mm screws and a 20mm nut bar.

- Then secure one end of the y-axis GT2 timing belt (2m long for normal model, 3.5m long for XL) to the belt clip using the belt installation reference guide.

|

- Feed the belt under the end V-wheel of the cross-slide, then over the pulley and under the remaining three V-wheels.

- The flat side of the belt should be in contact with your V-wheels while the toothed side should engage with the teeth on the pulley.

|

- Secure the belt at the other end of the gantry with another belt clip, 20 mm nut bar, and two M5 x 10mm screws.

- Ensure there is a small amount of tension on the belt once everything is in place.
