Tracks
===================

- AgriBotâ€™s tracks allow the gantry to move precisely along the x-axis.

- They are designed to attach to a raised bed or similar supporting infrastructure.

- Each track is composed of 1.5m long aluminum extrusions positioned end-to-end to form a total track length of 3m for normal models and 6m for XL model.
