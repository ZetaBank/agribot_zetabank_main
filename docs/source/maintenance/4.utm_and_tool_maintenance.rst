UTM and Tool Maintenance
===========================

Inspect the UTM o-rings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- It is possible that intense temperature and adverse weather cycles could degrade the rubber o-rings on the bottom of the UTM.

Remove magnet debris
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- It is possible for dust, soil, and other debris to magnetically attract to the UTM and Tool magnets and build up over time.

- This debris can prevent the UTM from correctly mounting tools.

|

Remove internal needle debris
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- It is possible for dust, soil, and other debris to become stuck inside of seed injectorâ€™s luer loock needles. 

- This can cause a loss of seed suction power and prevent the seed injector from working reliably.

|

Dissolve mineral buildup in the watering nozzle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- It is possible - depending on your water source - for the watering nozzle to slowly become clogged with mineral buildup and other deposits. 

- This can prevent AgriBot from watering the correct amount for each plant and can also cause uneven spray.

Remove weeder and soil sensor debris
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- It is possible for dirt and other debris to become stuck between the weeder implements or build up on the contacts of the soil sensor which could cause inaccurate readings.
