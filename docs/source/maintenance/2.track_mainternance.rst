Track Maintenance
===========================

Clean track surfaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Once a month, inspect your tracks for an accumulation of mud, dirt, and other debris. Because the tracks are so low to the ground, it is common for them to accumulate unwanted materials.

- This can create unnecessary friction for the gantry when moving across the tracks, ultimately leading it to bind up if the tracks are not cleaned.

Maintain track alignment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- AgriBotâ€™s tracks need to be very straight and parallel with each other in order for the gantry to move smoothly across them.

- With time, the tracks may move and twist due to a variety of factors such as:

    - Screws becoming loose

    - Thermal expansion and contraction due to large temperature swings

    - Deterioration of supporting infrastructure such as wood posts

    - Supporting infrastructure shifting due to soil expansion and contraction

    - Falling branches, earthquakes, or other cataclysmic events

- Misaligned tracks can cause the system to creak and ultimately bind as the gantry attempts to move across the tracks.

- This can prevent AgriBot from working and even cause damage to other components.

- If you notice your tracks have become misaligned, work to fix them as soon as possible with the following suggestions.

Realigning track plates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Signs of a misaligned track plate include misaligned track extrusions (see below), twisted track extrusions, difficulty in the gantry moving across extrusion joints, and even visual misalignment.

Realigning track extrusions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- It is possible for a track extrusion to loosen and then become misaligned with an adjacent extrusion.

- Even small misalignments can prevent the gantry from smoothly moving across joints.

- Inspect for misalignment by running your fingers across track joints.
